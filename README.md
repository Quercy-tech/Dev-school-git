So what will you find here?
## Some code:
```js
this.translateText = function(str, operation) {
        let result = '';
        for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
            const char = str[i];
            const keyChar = this.key[i % this.key.length];
            result += operation(char, keyChar);
        }
        return result;
    }
```
